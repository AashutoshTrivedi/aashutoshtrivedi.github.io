Git is a open source version control system. Wait! but what the heck is version control. Not going into very advanced aspects, version control simply means, having the full control on the version of your software file, which in-turn means that this is a type of software that contains all the previous build of our software.

Still difficult? Ok lets take an example why git is used and what makes it an integral part of the IT community. The typical software cycle involves a lot of steps like development, deployment, testing etc involving a large number of people working in collaboration.
