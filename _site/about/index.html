<p>Hello I’m <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aashutosh Trivedi</code>, an associate software developer at Cognizant and a data science and machine learning enthusiast. Prior to Cognizant, completed graduation from IIT Jammu and developed exceptional skills while serving as General Secretary, Student’s Council IIT Jammu
If I describe myself in one line - that would be - always eager to learn. I have always introduced myself as a lover of technology, a technophile, a presenter, a leader and an achiever.</p>

<p>As a graduate in mechanical engineering from <a href="iitjammu.ac.in">IIT Jammu</a>, I was always inspired to grab each and every possible opportunity thrown at me by life. Had an opportunity to work with an amazing team to create a first all terrain vehicle, been fortunate enough to lead a team to draft first constitution of IIT jammu and likewise a lot more. The many hats worn by me from being a mechanical engineer by degree to software engineer and machine learning enthusiast continue to inspire and feed my curiosity.</p>

<h2 id="journey"><em>Journey</em></h2>

<p>Talking about my journey, it all starts back from my school time. I was always privileged to lead and work with some wonderful team. In class tenth, I was elected house captain of red house, playing an important role in the sports and annual cultural celebration.Adding to this experience, I was appointed the captain of NCC batch during year 2013. I wear many such experiences that have sculptured my personality and made me who I’m today.</p>

<p>I had been the general secretary of students body, and been an integral part of the Baja team who are proud enough to be called a first third-gen IIT to take part in car design competition within it’s second year of establishment.</p>

<p>Apart from it I’m deeply passionate about the new technology and its impact on transforming the society. I have a my interests in the field of machine learning, data analytics and cloud based computing.</p>

<p>Coming on the internships, I interned with Jugaad Analytics which is an analytical firm located in Amsterdam which works in the field of predictive maintenance , big data Analytics and Stock market prediction. You can read more about it <a href="/aashutoshtrivedi.github.io/jugaad/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Rest of the internships were in mechanical domain, so I’ll skip those. I will write about them sometime later in a blog post, as it was something very technical and interesting.
